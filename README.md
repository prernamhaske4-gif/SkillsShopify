🚀 Excited to share our latest Group project – SkillsShopify!

I built SkillsShopify, a Django-based E-commerce platform designed for sellers to easily manage and showcase their products across categories like Electronics, Clothing, and Home Appliances.

🔑 Key Features:
✅ Add, Edit, and Delete products with category management
✅ Apply discount percentages with automatic selling price calculation
✅ Product search bar and dropdown filters for quick navigation
✅ Clean dashboard using Bootstrap UI and SQLite/MySQL database
✅ Backend prepared for future AI/ML-based recommendation systems

🛠 Tech Stack: Python | Django | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Bootstrap | SQLite/MySQL | Git

💡 Through this project, I gained strong hands-on experience in backend development, business logic automation, and full-stack E-commerce design.
