ðŸš€ Excited to share our latest Group project â€“ SkillsShopify!

I built SkillsShopify, a Django-based E-commerce platform designed for sellers to easily manage and showcase their products across categories like Electronics, Clothing, and Home Appliances.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
âœ… Add, Edit, and Delete products with category management
âœ… Apply discount percentages with automatic selling price calculation
âœ… Product search bar and dropdown filters for quick navigation
âœ… Clean dashboard using Bootstrap UI and SQLite/MySQL database
âœ… Backend prepared for future AI/ML-based recommendation systems

ðŸ›  Tech Stack: Python | Django | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Bootstrap | SQLite/MySQL | Git

ðŸ’¡ Through this project, I gained strong hands-on experience in backend development, business logic automation, and full-stack E-commerce design.
